        I am a computer science student and full-stack JavaScript developer
        focused on the MERN stack and TypeScript. I am passionate about web
        development and spend my time learning, experimenting, and improving my
        skills with React on the frontend and Node.js/Express on the backend. I
        am also a DevOps enthusiast, interested in how modern tooling,
        automation, and deployment practices can support the applications I
